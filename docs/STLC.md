# Smart Health Tracker - Software Testing Life Cycle Plan

## 1. Test Planning
- **Objectives:** Validate functional accuracy, ensure seamless cross-platform experience, verify data integrity and security.
- **Scope:** Web (React) frontend, mobile (Flutter) app, Node.js backend APIs, database integration.
- **Resources:** QA engineer, automation engineer, product owner for UAT.
- **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, Flutter test, Postman, Firebase emulator suite, GitHub Actions.
- **Test Environment:**
  - Staging backend with seeded anonymized data.
  - Web app hosted via preview deployment.
  - Mobile app built as debug APK / iOS simulator build.

## 2. Test Analysis
- Review SRS and user stories to derive test conditions.
- Identify critical workflows: authentication, data entry, dashboard visualization, alerts, synchronization.
- Map requirements to test cases using Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM).

## 3. Test Design
- Prepare test cases covering:
  - Positive and negative login scenarios.
  - Manual metric entry validation (range checks, required fields).
  - Wearable data synchronization mocks.
  - Dashboard chart rendering across date ranges.
  - Goal achievement notifications.
  - Admin analytics access control.
- Define test data sets (valid metrics, boundary values, erroneous inputs).
- Create automation scripts for regression suites (Cypress end-to-end, Jest unit tests, Flutter widget tests).
- Document expected results and acceptance criteria for each test.

## 4. Test Environment Setup
- Configure CI workflow to deploy test backend and seed data.
- Integrate Firebase emulator or local MySQL instance for isolated testing.
- Establish environment variables for API keys and secrets using `.env.test`.
- Ensure logging and monitoring available (e.g., Firebase console, Sentry).

## 5. Test Execution
- Execute unit tests on every pull request.
- Run integration and end-to-end suites nightly and before milestones.
- Record results in test execution log including build number, tester, environment, pass/fail status.
- Capture screenshots/videos for UI test evidence.

## 6. Test Cycle Closure
- Consolidate metrics: test case coverage, pass percentage, defect density, mean time to resolve.
- Conduct retrospective focusing on testing efficiency and improvements.
- Sign-off criteria: all blocker/high defects resolved, regression suite green, stakeholders approve UAT.

## 7. Test Deliverables
- Test Plan document (this file).
- Test cases and RTM stored in `/docs/testing/`.
- Automated test scripts under project source directories.
- Test execution reports exported from CI pipeline.

## 8. Entry and Exit Criteria
- **Entry:** Approved SRS, stable build in staging, test environment configured.
- **Exit:** All planned tests executed, defects triaged and resolved/deferred with approval, final reports published.

## 9. Roles & Responsibilities
- **QA Lead:** Maintain test plan, coordinate testing activities, manage defect triage.
- **Automation Engineer:** Develop and maintain automated suites.
- **Developers:** Provide unit tests, assist with defect reproduction and fixes.
- **Product Owner:** Validate acceptance criteria during UAT.

## 10. Metrics & Reporting
- Daily stand-up updates on test status.
- Burn-down chart for outstanding test cases.
- Weekly dashboard summarizing defects by severity, test execution progress, and coverage.
