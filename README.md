# Smart Health Tracker

Comprehensive capstone project that delivers a cross-platform health monitoring solution. Users can log and visualize daily metrics (steps, calories, heart rate, sleep), optionally integrate wearable devices, and receive actionable insights and alerts.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Develop both **web** (React) and **mobile** (Flutter/React Native) clients.
- Implement secure backend services (Node.js/Firebase) with persistent storage (Firestore/MySQL).
- Demonstrate end-to-end SDLC, STLC, and Defect Life Cycle documentation and execution.
- Provide working prototype with authentication, data tracking, and dashboard visualization.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
```
├── docs/
│   ├── SRS.md
│   ├── SDLC.md
│   ├── STLC.md
│   ├── Defect_Life_Cycle.md
│   └── Final_Report_Template.md
└── README.md
```

Additional subdirectories (e.g., `/docs/diagrams`, `/docs/testing`, `/web`, `/mobile`, `/backend`) will be added as implementation progresses.

## 📄 Key Documents
- **[SRS](docs/SRS.md):** Functional & non-functional requirements, use cases, technology stack.
- **[SDLC Plan](docs/SDLC.md):** Agile sprint roadmap with phase-specific activities.
- **[STLC Plan](docs/STLC.md):** Testing strategy, deliverables, and metrics.
- **[Defect Life Cycle](docs/Defect_Life_Cycle.md):** Workflow, severity matrix, and reporting templates.
- **[Final Report Template](docs/Final_Report_Template.md):** Outline for compiling end-of-project findings.

## 📅 High-Level Roadmap
1. **Planning (Weeks 1-2):** Finalize SRS, backlog, and team roles.
2. **Design (Weeks 3-4):** Produce wireframes, architecture diagrams, and database schema.
3. **Development (Weeks 5-8):** Build web/mobile interfaces, backend APIs, and database integrations. Comment code thoroughly per academic requirements.
4. **Testing (Weeks 9-10):** Execute unit, integration, system, and UAT; log defects per documented life cycle.
5. **Evaluation (Week 11):** Deliver final demo, consolidate documentation, and reflect on outcomes.
